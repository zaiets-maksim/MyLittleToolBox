# MyLittleToolBox üõ†Ô∏è
Here I have collected my small tool collection for Unity

* **MaterialOptimizerTool.cs** - enables GPU Instance on all materials
* **ProjectWindowResourceSize.cs** - displays weight in KB on all assets in the Project window
* **TimeScaleWindow.cs** - the window for convenient changes in Timescale during PlayMode
* **SceneNavigator.cs** - A window for convenient movement between the scenes. Displays all scenes from Buildsettings and the recent 10. Shortcut: _Ctrl+Shift+O_
